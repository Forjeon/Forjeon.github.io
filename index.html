	<p style="margin-left: 10%; width: 80%">In this game environment I experiment with the accuracy and tactile-control that hand-tracked VR apps can offer. The system can recognize any hand-finger pose and--after a calibration phase--recall and identify said poses at any later time. A 'system alert' gesture is used to tell the system to look for the poses; this saves on processing power by only running the pose-checker when the user intends to activate a pose.<br><br>I also built the custom scipts that control the playing, looping, and changing of sound effects, as well as the scripts controlling the firing, charging, projectile settings, and projectile interactions. This game also features IK rigging on the player avatar, allowing arms and a full body to be visible without adding in additional tracking hardware / software.</p>

	<p style="margin-left: 10%; width: 80%">SBRES is a python program I built to help me with making journal entries, engineering notebooks, and managing a diary. It runs from the command prompt and has intelligent filtering of user input to make sure no errors are thrown. It remembers a set of projects the user creates and modifies by checking and updating a log file. The user can add either a text or image entry to the system by typing or specifying the local path and SBRES will record it with a caption. Once recorded, the system writes each day's entry to it's own html document with links to an index page that interconnects all pages.<br><br>Unfortunately, this project is a couple years old now and I have yet to patch a few bugs related to running it with the latest python build. However, the majority of SBRES' coding has survived the test of time and only the final html-writer method has broken because of outdated code.</p>

	<p style="margin-left: 10%; width: 80%">The command mechanic in Minecraft is essentially a watered-down coding language. In many ways, 'programming' something in Minecraft through commands is harder than traditional coding because of the creativity required to circumvent the many limitations. In these two project examples, I utilize an internal variable-storage table to keep track of events, positions, speeds, collision, and etc. on a 1/20th second update loop called a 'tick'.<br><br>In the first project, a series of magic spells were created. They pull from a recharging mana pool and have complex interactions with the environment, as well as with other players, enemies, and even other spells. They each have their own distinct sounds as well; custom made by overlapping and modulating in-game sounds to create a visceral response to each arcane tool.<br><br>In the second project, I made a mock-up of the Tron lightcycle game as seen in Tron Legacy. The 'bikes' can move in three dimensions, react to a custom-built gravity engine, are aware of the terrain and can scale slopes and 'ramps', and can jump and change their speed based on user input (something surprisingly hard to track using commands).</p>

	<p style="margin-left: 10%; width: 80%">Metroid Cubed 4, a.k.a MC4, is a mod that aims to bring Metroid to Minecraft. After I had submitted a few minor models and ideas, the mod owner 'promoted' me to the title of 'contributer'. This encouraged me to offer some more help to the mod, and soon I was again promoted, this time to one of two 'mod developers'. I now take part in official meetings and discussions over bugs, features, deadlines, and more as co-second-in-command of the mod.<br><br>I am not a programmer for this mod, but I am a modeler-animator. All my work is completely original, though the source material it is based on is clearly not mine. I build all of my models for MC4 in a modeling program developed by the mod owner himself (unless they require non-voxel details, which I build in Blender and import into the program). I also handle all of the texturing, rigging, and animating of the models I create. As it stands, I'm the only graphics artist responsible for creature and vehicle models, textures, and animations.</p>
