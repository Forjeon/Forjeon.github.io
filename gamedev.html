	<p style="margin-left: 10%; width: 80%">This is a demo for a game I began early in my 8th grade year. I sadly never finished it, but it was my first ever finished demo (made solo) and I am still very proud of it. It is built in the Blender Game Engine, using the Bullet physics engine and running entirely on Python. For the demo, I had a working weapon with realistic accuracy (rather, lack thereof), a solid and snappy jump / double jump, running, and a simple AI enemy. All assets were custom made by me in Blender, as was all of the demo's level design and all scripts controlling the player's actions. Along with the fact that I never finished development of the game, the hard drive it was on was corrupted a few years back, so all sound files and some newer features I was adding have been lost or corrupted.</p>

	<p style="margin-left: 10%; width: 80%">This C# dedicated server app comes in two forms. The first is a stand-alone executable which handles client packets and synchronizes the data to all connected sockets, while also maintaining continuity and handling missing/invalid packets. The second form simply integrates the stand-alone module directly into the Unity Game Engine. This allows for more game-tailored handling of client data, such as server-only collisions and logic, thereby speeding up the clientside by only needing to render graphics and send packet updates to the server.<br><br>Both versions of the server are based on the exact same code, only modified slightly for integration into Unity. The system is capable of sending any data type in a packet, including stringing multiple types into one send. The packets can even include custom data types, such as the Unity specific Vector3 variable type. The packets can be sent along TCP or UDP data lines, depending on the desire, and the socket connections are maintained with total authority from the server—minimizing data misalignment between clients.</p>

	<p style="margin-left: 10%; width: 80%">I am a huge fan of the table-top RPG Dungeons and Dragons, and VR being so immersive I started development on 'Roleplay Legend Adventure Quest'. 'RLAQ' will be a FPS RPG in a world built (or procedurally generated) and managed by a Game Master. The players will have complete freedom in their actions, and the Game Master will be able to create as realistic and creative a world as modern gaming will allow. Combat has been specifically designed to be as realistic and fun as possible. Weapon damage is based on the type (sword, axe, etc.), the momentum, and where the strike lands. Attacks can be made, blocked, parried, dodged, or missed according to the players and AI / Game Master's skill and digression. All details will be up to the players, and ultimately the Game Master as to how fighting is run (turn-based vs real-time), the world that is explored (custom made, procedural, or template), and what goes down in the story of their adventures. So far, I am working on how the player will grab and interact with their gear. This is my first VR game, so I'm still overcoming the learning curve with VR Unity and Oculus documentation.</p>

	<p style="margin-left: 10%; width: 80%">This is a Metroid fangame that is played first-person in VR and uses only hand-tracking for user input—no controllers. The player is Samus Aran, and they will play through a fantastic world as if they were actually there. The game will focus on enriching exploration with minimal platforming, exciting and immersive combat, and subtle storytelling. All mechanics will be expressed through realistic, diegetic means, such as accessing the holographic map screen by a button pad on the player's arm cannon. Currently, I am putting a lot of effort into the locomotion of the game; I want an immersive and interactive experience with as little annoying platforming or VR motion sickness as possible. The various weapon functions are managed by a custom system I designed that keeps track of the user's physical hand pose and responds to specific hand-signs and gestures when given a 'system check' gesture.</p>
